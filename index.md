## Welcome to my communications portfolio page

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/JUngvari/portfolio/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to access and view the content from this website that is publicly available.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/JUngvari/portfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
